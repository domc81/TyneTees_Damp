,,,Image Best Practices:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,¥ Use the 'Alt' key to align an image to the bottom of the cell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,¥ To format an image right click on it to set the height and/or crop ( a good starting height is 6cm).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,¥ Try to keep images the same height especially if on the same row and ensure you use the 'alt' key to align the image to the bottom of the cell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,¥ Try and keep the images a fraction smaller than the cell height to prevent overspill if the image cell falls on a page break.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,¥ Try and keep the images centrally above their descriptions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
